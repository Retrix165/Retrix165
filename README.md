### Short and Sweet About Me
  I'm a CS undergraduate student in North Texas seeking summer internships and project oppurtunities to gain real-world experience and valuably contribute within my position.

### Projects and Interest
  Currently, I'm starting work on a research team over smart contracts, implementing a virtual CPU, and pursuing a compiler design certification. 
  
  On the research team, we hope to analyze logical vulnerabilities within cryptocurrency smart contracts in order to expose methods of exploitation and make security reccomendations. This is my first *official* research position on a team, so I'm very excited to learn more about the research process and contribute to my team. In my virtual CPU project, I'm going to be implementing a 32-bit RISC-V CPU using Verilog in order to learn more about behavioral RTL design. I was inspired to do this after completing structural RTL design projects in a computer engineering course called nand2tetris. Finally, my school is offering a course in practical compiler design which I will be taking this this semster. The compiler will generate LLVM from C and will be written in Python.
  
  In the past, I have worked on creating an image maze solver application using Python, a stock analysis web application, and some assorted explorations into cryptography. I am proud of my work on the image maze solver. Firstly, it's cool. Secondly, it had an engaging final product of visualizing the pathfinding processes of different algorithms including BFS and A* in a neat animation. The stock analysis website came from my first hackathon I did with friends last semester in which we fetched finanical data of companies on the stock market and gave a rating based off of certain calculations. This project was certainly haphazard but rewarding to create a finished product. In a previous summer, I took time to investigate the basics of cryptography by coding challenges on CryptoHack and notes on college textbooks of the subject. I found the subject very interesting but hard without a lot of math foundations I didn't have at the time.
